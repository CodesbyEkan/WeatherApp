        ClimateCue is a web app that provides accurate weather forecasts for
        users. It integrates the functionality of APIs for real-time data.
      </p>

      <p>
        The app was created for users who don‚Äôt understand the data displayed on
        their screen whenever they come across such data as wind speed etc. With
        ClimateCue, you get a fundamental breakdown of each data, enabling you
        to make proper designs on your plans regarding weather outcomes.

        My name is Ekanem Victor, I‚Äôm a Software Engineer & Web Developer
        Intern, I currently work with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React & Python.
      </p>

      <p>
        It all started when I attended ‚ÄúAPI Conf 2024‚Äù in Lagos, I must say it
        was a great experience getting to know the possibilities one can reach
        with such a powerful programming tool. I also got to work with some cool
        features that enabled me to interact with my device such as geolocation.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have developed a functional web-based weather forecast application
        that, upon receiving permission, can detect your location and provide
        real-time weather updates specific to that area. Additionally, it
        archives previous forecasts for future reference.
      </p>

      <p>
        My greatest technical challenge involved mastering async functions,
        callback functions, and Promises. Initially, they were perplexing, but
        through persistent practice and revision, I eventually grasped them.
      </p>

      <h2>Technical Take-Away:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Working with JSON files help you manage objects in Javascript. FlexBox
          helps you create a responsive user interface.
        </li>
        <li>Learn how to start my project on time always‚Ä¶lolüòÇüòÅ</li>
        <li>
          That a lot is possible with a growth mindset and problem-solving
          skills.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Thanks to Alx SE course, I now have a ground understanding of how things
        work. Both technically & Non-technically.
      </p>
      <p>
        <emp>Now I truly believe that API is the future of programming!</emp>
